# GraphQL Summit 2023 Coprocessors Workshop
​
## ⚠️ Before the workshop
​
Please complete the following pre-requisites and installations before the workshop.
​
You will need to:
​
- [ ] [Download the Apollo Router binary](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/quickstart#download-options).
- [ ] [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). We will rely on docker and docker-compose for a step of the observability section of the workshop. The workshop will provide a docker-compose.yml file that has everything the router needs (subgraphs + a telemetry stack). The subgraphs we will reuse are also available via a public URL.
- [ ] Tools to code and run a local web server. We will use Node.js (18) and Express for the workshop, but you can use any framework and language you’re comfortable writing a web server with.
- [ ] Clone this repository.
- [ ] (Optional) An Apollo GraphOS account with either:
  - An Enterprise plan, with at least [Contributor access](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) in your organization.
  - An [Enterprise Trial](https://studio.apollographql.com/signup?type=enterprise-trial), for those without an Enterprise plan.
  - If you already have an Apollo GraphOS account with an Enterprise plan, or an Enterprise Trial, then great! You will be able to work on a supergraph schema you’re comfortable with, and start customizing your router according to your needs! Otherwise we will provide you with a trial account that is set up for the workshop. The provided credentials will expire after summit.
